## Introduction

## Business Model

This a business to customer business, B to C modle, built around a community. The site will offer a traditional retail experience, with the goal of engaging customers who are interested in the product and want to learn more about its background, attend tastings, and hear talks from winemakers and other industry specialists. The wine club will produce informative and engaging blog posts, host wine tasting events, and offer member discounts and monthly wine samples curated around themes and events.  The club will offer a subscription service to provide customers with a convenient and hassle-free way to discover and enjoy new wines. The business will also offer products related to wine, including wine glasses, decanters, wine opener, and other related products.  

## Preparation

### Wireframes

Before using Balsamiq to layout my design, I prefer to utilize simple hand drawn sketches to develop my websites. To have a better understanding of the design and functionality, I took some time to examine and dissect other websites that I found enjoyable.

### Agile Development

In the development of this e-commerce Django site, Agile methodologies were employed. The project was organised into various Tasks, contributing to overarching Epics that represented large-scale features and goals. To track the progress and ensure that stages were achieved, milestones were set at key points throughout the project timeline.

User Stories were created and divided between the site owner and the customer to represent the different requirements and positions of these two groups. User Stories covered issues like customer management and inventory control for the website owner. The focus for the customer, was on enhancing user experience through seamless navigation, efficient checkouts, and intuitive search functionalities. By combining Agile practices with clearly defined milestones, the I was able to prioritise work, adapt to changes, and hopefully produce a functional ecommerce website.

## Features

### Homepage

The homepage will feature a large hero image, with the title of the business. The image will take up 100% of the viewport. The shop link will be prominently displayed on the page. The website owner will be able to use this landing page to create a theme for the site, either to promote a product, an event, or a season.

As the user scrolls down, they will see bold images with links to different sections of the shop. For example, a "Bold Reds" image would bring the user to a curated selection of red wines. The homepage will also contain links to the blog and wine club, with information about upcoming events.

### Blog

A wine blog can be a useful marketing tool for an online wine shop in a number of ways. First, it can help the owner to educate customers about the different aspects of wine, such as regions, styles, and varieties. This can help customers to make more informed choices when purchasing wine from the shop.

A wine blog can help to promote the wine shop to new customers. By publishing high-quality blog posts that are relevant to a target audience, you can attract visitors to the website and encourage them to learn more about the business. It can also help to build relationships with customers. By sharing interesting and useful information about wine, the owner can show customers that they are knowledgeable and passionate about the product they sell.

An example of blog post could be about different types of wine that are for sale, discussing a particular region or variety available in the store. You could also write about specific winemakers and wineries. The owner could blog about wine and food parings or wine tasting events. Provide a tips and advice section.

A wine blog can be used to populate other marketing channels, such as Facebook and Instagram, with engaging and informative content. Additionally, Google places higher ranking on authoritative sources, so a regularly updated blog can assist the overall business with SEO rankings.

## Marketing
Leveraging both Facebook and a dedicated blog, I aim to create a dynamic online presence for my wine shop. Facebook is invaluable for real-time engagement, where the owener can post daily updates on new arrivals, special promotions, and upcoming tasting events. The blog, on the other hand, serves as a platform for more in-depth content, including wine pairing guides and interviews with vineyard owners. Together, these platcforms not only attract new customers but also build a community of wine enthusiasts.
